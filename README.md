HOW TO CREATE OUR PRINTF FUNCTION

1.for the creation of our printf function we use our #include library "holberton.h" which contains the definitions of our functions that we will use for our printf function.
which is the one that contains the definitions of our functions that we will use for the correct operation of our printf.
correct operation of our printf.
2. we will create functions with which our printf will work
-printf_char.c
-printf_string.c
-printf_int.c
3. we will use Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...); which is an enclosed library function.
 c which sends an output in stdout format.
